    <p>Dear Sofie,</p>
    <p>A boy at my school always calls me names like cow and dog and like other farm animals and stuff all the time because he says he knows a lot of people who have a cow or a dog that’s named the same thing as me. I guess like pretty much everyone in the world has some animal with my name… Anyway it’s starting to kinda suck more and more cuz now the buses got changed and we ride the bus together pretty much every day. My mom said don’t worry, it’s pretty and it was my grandma’s nickname but not my real name anyway and I should just ignore him. I thought maybe I should ask people to call me my real name but it’s kinda crazy too and they always ask if my mom was a hippy or from China or something, cuz of my name and sometimes cuz of how my eyes are when I smile big. Anyway, she told me to just ignore them and that they’re just jealous, but that doesn’t make sense cuz why would anyone want a cow name? Well, my mom’s smart but I think I need a second opinion from you cuz ignoring it seems like it’s not working very well. What should I do? What would you do?</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br />

    <p>Dear Sick of Stupid Boys,</p>
    <p>First of all, this boy sounds like he might have been raised by cows or dogs and like other farm animals and stuff. Second of all, though I don’t know your name, I’m sure it’s beautiful, if only because it’s yours! I’d like to meet all the animals with your name, I’m sure they are more swell than the rest.</p>
    <p>If ignoring is not working, here is a list of things I would contemplate doing:</p>
    <p>1) Walk up to him on the playground at recess, preferably when his back is turned, and tap him on the shoulder…when he turns around, bark loudly or moo like you’ve never barked or mooed before. Then tell him he always smells slightly like old rotten cheese.</p>
    <p>2) Hijack the school’s PA system, and publicly address your harasser’s unfortunate body odor. Warn other students to stay away.</p>
    <p>3) The next time he calls you cow or dog or another farm animal name, scream “my mommy says you are just jealous or that you’re in love with me!!!!!” And then run away.</p>
    <p>4) Tell him you are bored with his lame attempts at flirting with you, flip your hair, and walk away.</p>
    <p>5) Ask him the size of his sixth grade dick. Ask him what grade his dick is in. When he doesn’t answer, tell him you think his dick hasn’t yet passed kindergarten, even though its been going to both the morning and afternoon kindergarten sessions for four and a half years.</p>
    <p>Seriously my dear, I think your mom is right. (And she must be very smart). You must hold your head up when your peers are being immature toward you. You can’t help how other people treat people, or treat you, but you can help how you treat them. Kill them with kindness. Keep smiling. Stay above it. You’ll come out just fine.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your question. Anytime you need a friend, I am here.</p>
    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Sofie</p>
    <p>P.S. This hedgehog’s name is Sofie. Moo</p>
    <p>Hope it makes you feel better.</p>
